My name is Chris Wagner. I like to write the codes but I'm also really lazy and my computer desk doesn't really have a working chair at the moment so mostly I just sit in a recliner and drink tea. I'll probably get back into coding someday. This blog is hosted on github pages because maintaining a halfway secure serving stack is actually lots of work?

My employer does not review this blog; nothing I write should be interpreted as being endorsed by or otherwise representative of my employer.
